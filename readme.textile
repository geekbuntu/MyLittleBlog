h2. My Little BLog

This code is my first actual Rails project, and powers my personal blog at www.openmymind.net. Hopefully it'll
prove useful to others looking to learn Rails. I'd appreciate feedback and tips since I'm sure, despite its simplicity,
that I'm doing stuff wrong.

h3. Configuration

You'll want to copy config.yml.example to config.yml and provide it with your specific settings. The hash password of "test" is:
ee26b0dd4af7e749aa1a8ee3c10ae9923f618980772e473f8819a5d4940e0db27ac185f8a0e1d5f84f88bc887fd67b143732c304cc5fa9ad8e6f57f50028a8ff

h3. Deployment

I use capistrano to manage deployment. config/deploy.rb is in .gitignore since I wasn't sure how to share the file (since it has a lot of specific stuff).

This is mostly what my deploy.rb file looks like:

pre. set :application, "Karl Seguin's Blog"
set :repository,  "git://github.com/karlseguin/MyLittleBlog.git"
set :scm, :git
set :branch, 'master'
ssh_options[:forward_agent] = true
set :deploy_via, :remote_cache
set :deploy_to, "/srv/www/openmymind/"
role :web, "openmymind.net"
role :app, "openmymind.net"
role :db,  "openmymind.net", :primary => true
after 'deploy:update_code', 'deploy:updated_code'
namespace :deploy do
  task :updated_code do
    run "cp #{deploy_to}/shared/public/* #{release_path}/public/"
    run "chown -R www-data:www-data #{release_path}"
    run "touch #{deploy_to}current/tmp/restart.txt"
    run "ln -nfs #{deploy_to}/shared/config/config.yml #{release_path}/config/config.yml"
  end
end
